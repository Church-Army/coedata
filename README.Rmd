coeparishdata is a data package that's built around various datasets made available by the Church of England's [Data Services](https://www.churchofengland.org/about/data-services) team. Data sources include:

- [x] [Parish-level census data](https://www.churchofengland.org/about/data-services/resources-publications-and-data) from ONS' 2021 Census of England and Wales (Updated November 2024)
- [x] A [database](https://services5.arcgis.com/KDRjxGRQDVgVtFTS/ArcGIS/rest/services/Churches_ACNY_Nov2024/FeatureServer) of Churches, Parishes, Dioceses and other geographies (Updated November 2024)
- [ ] ~~[Parish-level data](https://www.churchofengland.org/about/data-services/resources-publications-and-data) from the 2019 Index of Multiple Deprivation~~ (PENDING)

National-level data are sourced directly from ONS data via [nomis](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/) (via [nomisr](https://github.com/ropensci/nomisr)).

## TODO:

- [x] Replace national level data with NOMIS census data
  - Aggregating parish data causes considerable rounding error
- [ ] Add data-dictionary vignettes
- [x] Create print methods for `"coe_parish_data"` class
- [x] Create methods for `dplyr` that preserve attributes in `"coe_parish_data"` objects
- [ ] Add IMD data
- [ ] Ensure appropriate credit/attribution/documentation
