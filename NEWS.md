# coedata (development version)

## 2025-01-23

coedata is ready for public testing!

## Changes

* Parish deprivation data is now available via `coe_parish_deprivation()`
* Small updates to vignettes

## 2025-01-08

### Changes

* Diocese-level data is now sourced directly from a weighted summation of the intersections between LLSOAs and dioceses. The previous method of summing parish-level statistics incurred a slight rounding error.
* Parish-level tibbles with class `"coe_parish_data"` now attribute the Church of England when printed.

## 2025-01-08

The package is nearly ready to go:

* Functions renamed for consistency
* Lots of documentation added
* Updated README

## 2024-11-28

* The foundational functions of the package are working!
