## coe_datasets()

Display information on all datasets available through this package. Default is to return a two-column tibble including `ons_id` and `description`, but setting `description = FALSE` will return a character vector of all valid nomis codes which can be passed to functions such as `coe_census()` 

```{r examples-coe_datasets}
coe_datasets() |>
  dplyr::glimpse()
```


## coe_census

Get statistics on a particular topic, for a particular geographical level, filtering as required. Levels include 'parish', 'diocese' or 'england'. Parishes can be filtered with parish codes and dioceses with diocese numbers, but national-level tables are comprised of a single row and cannot be filtered.

```{r examples-coe_census}
coe_census(ons_id =  "TS001", level = "england")
coe_census(ons_id = "TS001", level = "diocese", areas = 1)
```



## coe_parish_census_context

```{r examples-coe_parish_census_context}
coe_parish_census_context(parish_code = "370047", ons_ids = "TS001")
```
