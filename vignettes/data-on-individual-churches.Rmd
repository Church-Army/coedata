The functions on this page all help with processing data related to individual churches:

* `coe_churches()` returns a tibble of every church in the Church of England, including information on its parish, benefice, deanery, archdeaconry and diocese. Data are read directly from the [ESRI feature server](https://services5.arcgis.com/KDRjxGRQDVgVtFTS/ArcGIS/rest/services/Churches_ACNY_Nov2024/FeatureServer) kindly provided by the Church of England's Data Services team.
* `coe_esri_fields()` is a helper function that returns valid fields which can be passed to the `where` argument of `coe_churches()` to query the dataset.
* `coe_parish_from_church()` returns a parish code for each of any number of church codes. Useful for obtaining a parish code from the church codes listed at [A Church Near You](https://www.achurchnearyou.com/)
